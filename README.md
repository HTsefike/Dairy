# Dairy
Dairies are one of the most important books in our lives 
it is not just a book but it is a book that contains 
the most important moments, feelings and emotions
in the exact time.
We all know that a dairy has to be a secret 
we dont want people looking or reading our vurnabilties 
so for us to keep our secrets safe 
we need to lock our dairies 
we are the only ones who know the the code or password
